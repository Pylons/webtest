Functional Testing of Web Applications
======================================

TestApp
=======

Making Requests
---------------

To make a request, use:

.. code-block:: python

    app.get('/path', [headers], [extra_environ], ...)

This does a request for ``/path``, with any extra headers or WSGI
environment keys that you indicate.  This returns a response object,
based on `webob.Response
<http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/reference.html#response>`_.  It has some
additional methods to make it easier to test.

If you want to do a POST request, use:

.. code-block:: python

    app.post('/path', {'vars': 'values'}, [headers], [extra_environ],
             [upload_files], ...)

Specifically the second argument is the *body* of the request.  You
can pass in a dictionary (or dictionary-like object), or a string
body (dictionary objects are turned into HTML form submissions).

You can also pass in the keyword argument upload_files, which is a
list of ``[(fieldname, filename, field_content)]``.  File uploads use a
different form submission data type to pass the structured data.

For other verbs you can use:

.. code-block:: python

    app.put(path, params, ...)
    app.delete(path, ...)

These do PUT and DELETE requests.


Modifying the Environment & Simulating Authentication
------------------------------------------------------

The best way to simulate authentication is if your application looks
in ``environ['REMOTE_USER']`` to see if someone is authenticated.
Then you can simply set that value, like:

.. code-block:: python

    app.get('/secret', extra_environ=dict(REMOTE_USER='bob'))

If you want *all* your requests to have this key, do:

.. code-block:: python

    app = TestApp(my_app, extra_environ=dict(REMOTE_USER='bob'))

What Is Tested By Default
--------------------------

A key concept behind WebTest is that there's lots of things you
shouldn't have to check everytime you do a request.  It is assumed
that the response will either be a 2xx or 3xx response; if it isn't an
exception will be raised (you can override this for a request, of
course).  The WSGI application is tested for WSGI compliance with
a slightly modified version of `wsgiref.validate
<http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-wsgiref.validate.html>`_
(modified to support arguments to ``InputWrapper.readline``)
automatically.  Also it checks that nothing is printed to the
``environ['wsgi.errors']`` error stream, which typically indicates a
problem (one that would be non-fatal in a production situation, but if
you are testing is something you should avoid).

To indicate another status is expected, use the keyword argument
``status=404`` to (for example) check that it is a 404 status, or
``status="*"`` to allow any status.

If you expect errors to be printed, use ``expect_errors=True``.

The TestResponse Object
========================

The response object is based on `webob.Response
<http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/reference.html#response>`_ with some additions
to help with testing.

The inherited attributes that are most interesting:

``response.status``:
    The text status of the response, e.g., ``"200 OK"``.

``response.status_int``:
    The text status_int of the response, e.g., ``200``.

``response.headers``:
    A dictionary-like object of the headers in the response.

``response.body``:
    The text body of the response.

``response.text``:
    The unicode text body of the response.

``response.normal_body``:
    The whitespace-normalized [#whitespace-normalized]_ body of the response.

``response.request``:
    The `webob.Request object
    <http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/reference.html#request>`_ used to generate
    this response.

The added methods:

``response.follow(**kw)``:
    Follows the redirect, returning the new response.  It is an error
    if this response wasn't a redirect.  Any keyword arguments are
    passed to ``app.get`` (e.g., ``status``).

``x in response``:
    Returns True if the string is found in the response body.
    Whitespace is normalized for this test.

``response.mustcontain(string1, string2, no=string3)``:
    Raises an error if any of the strings are not found in the
    response.  It also prints out the response in that case, so
    you can see the real response.

``response.showbrowser()``:
    Opens the HTML response in a browser; useful for debugging.

``str(response)``:
    Gives a slightly-compacted version of the response.  This is
    compacted to remove newlines, making it easier to use with
    `doctest <http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html>`_

``response.click(description=None, linkid=None, href=None, anchor=None, index=None, verbose=False)``:
    Clicks the described link (see :class:`~webtest.TestResponse.click`)

``response.forms``:
    Return a dictionary of forms; you can use both indexes (refer to
    the forms in order) or the string ids of forms (if you've given
    them ids) to identify the form. See :doc:`forms` for more on the form
    objects.

``response.form``:
    If there is just a single form, this returns that.  It is an error
    if you use this and there are multiple forms.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#whitespace-normalized] The whitespace normalization replace sequences of whitespace characters and ``\n`` ``\r`` ``\t`` by a single space.

Parsing the Body
----------------

There are several ways to get parsed versions of the response.  These
are the attributes:

``response.html``:
    Return a `BeautifulSoup
    <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_ version of the
    response body::

        >>> res = app.get('/index.html')
        >>> res.html
        <html><body><div id="content">hey!</div></body></html>
        >>> res.html.__class__
        <class '...BeautifulSoup'>

``response.xml``:
    Return an `ElementTree
    <http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xml.etree.ElementTree.html>`_
    version of the response body::

        >>> res = app.get('/document.xml')
        >>> res.xml
        <Element 'xml' ...>
        >>> res.xml[0].tag
        'message'
        >>> res.xml[0].text
        'hey!'


``response.lxml``:
    Return an `lxml <http://codespeak.net/lxml/>`_ version of the
    response body::

        >>> res = app.get('/index.html')
        >>> res.lxml
        <Element html at ...>
        >>> res.lxml.xpath('//body/div')[0].text
        'hey!'

        >>> res = app.get('/document.xml')
        >>> res.lxml
        <Element xml at ...>
        >>> res.lxml[0].tag
        'message'
        >>> res.lxml[0].text
        'hey!'

``response.pyquery``:
    Return an `PyQuery <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyquery>`_ version of the
    response body::

        >>> res.pyquery('message')
        [<message>]
        >>> res.pyquery('message').text()
        'hey!'

``response.json``:
    Return the parsed JSON (parsed with `simplejson
    <http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/simplejson/tags/simplejson-1.7/docs/index.html>`_)::

        >>> res = app.get('/object.json')
        >>> sorted(res.json.values())
        [1, 2]


In each case the content-type must be correct or an AttributeError is
raised.  If you do not have the necessary library installed (none of
them are required by WebTest), you will get an ImportError.

TestResponse API
----------------

Some of the return values return instances of these classes:

.. autoclass:: TestResponse
   :members:

Framework Hooks
===============

Frameworks can detect that they are in a testing environment by the
presence (and truth) of the WSGI environmental variable
``"paste.testing"`` (the key name is inherited from
``paste.fixture``).

More generally, frameworks can detect that something (possibly a test
fixture) is ready to catch unexpected errors by the presence and truth
of ``"paste.throw_errors"`` (this is sometimes set outside of testing
fixtures too, when an error-handling middleware is in place).

Frameworks that want to expose the inner structure of the request may
use ``"paste.testing_variables"``.  This will be a dictionary -- any
values put into that dictionary will become attributes of the response
object.  So if you do ``env["paste.testing_variables"]['template'] =
template_name`` in your framework, then ``response.template`` will be
``template_name``.
